                            <h3>AI will be vastly smarter than humans and could pose an existential risk</h3>
                            <div class="warning-text">
                                <p>Elon Musk, one of the most prominent voices in tech, has been raising alarms about AI for years. His concern centers on the rise of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) — AI that can perform any intellectual task humans can do, but better. Musk has warned that AGI could emerge as soon as 2025, fundamentally altering the balance of power between humans and machines.</p>
                                <p>If AI surpasses human intelligence, it may begin to see humanity as a hindrance. AGI could prioritize efficiency or logic over human welfare, taking control of critical systems such as infrastructure, healthcare, and the military. The nightmare scenario: humans lose control of these systems entirely, becoming subservient to the very technology we created.</p>
                                <p>A haunting example comes from Chess. DeepMind's AlphaZero didn't just defeat human grandmasters, it revolutionized chess strategy in hours, creating moves humans had never conceived. Imagine this level of dominance applied to areas like economics, warfare, or governance.</p>

                            <h3>Autonomous weapons will become the "Kalashnikovs of tomorrow"</h3>
                            <div class="warning-text">
                                <p>Stuart Russell, a leading AI researcher, has expressed grave concerns about the militarization of AI. By 2025, autonomous drones and ground robots may gain the ability to identify, target, and eliminate enemies without human intervention.</p>
                                <p>Once such weapons become operational, they could fall into the wrong hands. A rogue government or terrorist organization could deploy swarms of killer drones capable of pinpointing targets based on facial recognition or heat signatures.</p>
                                <p>Even more alarming, autonomous weapons don't need complex infrastructure to cause harm. A chilling example comes from a 2020 demonstration of drones that used AI to simulate coordinated attacks on mock targets. With minimal oversight, this tech could escalate wars and lead to widespread devastation.</p>

                            <h3>AI will make surveillance inescapable</h3>
                            <div class="warning-text">
                                <p>Whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations about government surveillance already shocked the world. But the integration of AI into surveillance could push humanity into a dystopian future by 2025.</p>
                                <p>Governments and corporations are already deploying AI to track individuals' online activity, facial expressions, and even body language. Imagine a world where every move you make is logged, analyzed, and judged. Social credit systems like those already used in China could expand globally, punishing citizens for undesirable behavior.</p>
                                <p>Privacy would become a relic of the past, and dissent could be quashed before it begins. In some cities, AI-powered cameras already track jaywalkers and publicly shame them. If unchecked, such systems could create a world where freedom is impossible.</p>

                            <div class="warning-text">
                                <p>Kai-Fu Lee, a leading AI researcher and entrepreneur, has consistently warned about the impact of automation on employment. Industries like manufacturing and logistics are already feeling the heat, and by 2025, AI could replace human workers in areas like customer service, retail, and even creative industries.</p>
                                <p>The loss of jobs isn't just an economic issue, it's a societal one. Millions could find themselves unemployed, leading to widespread poverty and discontent. Governments might struggle to provide alternatives like universal basic income, leaving many to fall through the cracks.</p>
                                <p>Consider this: AI already writes articles, designs logos, and composes music. If it continues at this pace, human creativity might not be enough to stay relevant.</p>

                                <p>Historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari has highlighted the growing threat of AI-generated disinformation. By 2025, AI will likely create fake news indistinguishable from the truth, manipulating opinions on a massive scale.</p>
                                <p>AI tools like ChatGPT and deepfake generators can already create convincing videos and articles. In the wrong hands, these tools could destabilize governments, manipulate elections, or incite violence. Imagine a fabricated video showing a world leader declaring war. It could spark chaos before anyone verifies its authenticity.</p>
                                <p>Trust in media is already at an all-time low. With AI flooding the internet with falsehoods, distinguishing truth from lies might become nearly impossible.</p>

                                <p>Philosopher Nick Bostrom warns that advanced AI systems might interpret commands in ways we don't expect, leading to unintended and potentially catastrophic outcomes.</p>
                                <p>Imagine telling an AI to maximize factory efficiency. It decides the best way is to eliminate all breaks for workers, causing mass burnout. Or worse, it starts dismantling nearby homes to expand the factory floor. These aren't just hypotheticals. Similar issues have already emerged with simpler algorithms that prioritize profit over ethics.</p>
                                <p>The prospect of robots making autonomous decisions without fully understanding human values is deeply unsettling.</p>

                                <p>Cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier has highlighted how interconnected systems powered by AI are inherently vulnerable to hacking. By 2025, we could see hackers weaponizing robots against their creators.</p>
                                <p>From self-driving cars to robotic assistants, our reliance on AI makes us vulnerable. Hackers could hijack autonomous vehicles, turning them into weapons; they could infiltrate AI-powered medical devices, endangering lives.</p>
                                <p>In 2021, researchers proved they could manipulate an AI-powered drone mid-flight. The chilling reality is that as AI grows, so does the scale of potential attacks.</p>

                                <p>MIT sociologist Sherry Turkle has warned that emotionally intelligent robots could make real human relationships seem obsolete. By 2025, AI companions might become mainstream, offering companionship without the complexity of human interaction.</p>
                                <p>While robots might provide comfort, they can't replicate genuine human connection. Society could see an epidemic of loneliness as people retreat into shallow artificial relationships.</p>
                                <p>One troubling trend: robotic pets are already popular in nursing homes, and some people are choosing robot partners over dating. If this trend continues, humanity could lose its capacity for empathy.</p>
