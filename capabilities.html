                        <p>By 2025, multimodal systems will be standard, with the ability to understand relationships between content in different formats. For example, systems will be able to analyze medical imagery alongside patient history, reference scientific literature, and generate comprehensive reports incorporating visual elements and natural language explanations.</p>
                        <p>By 2027, these systems will expand to incorporate more subtle modalities like tactile feedback, 3D spatial understanding, and time-series data, enabling applications in robotics, immersive environments, and complex physical simulations.</p>
                        <p>By 2029, multimodal systems will begin to develop emergent capabilities from the integration of different modalities, showing understanding that transcends any single input type and generating novel insights from cross-modal relationships.</p>

Rather than simple tools that execute specific commands, AI will become an active collaborator that anticipates needs, suggests approaches, and adapts to individual working styles. Interface paradigms will shift from command-based to conversation-based, with persistent context maintained across interactions.</p>

                        <p>By 2028, AI will increasingly mediate our experience of digital information, dynamically translating between human intentions and digital systems. This will manifest in intelligent interfaces that adapt content presentation based on context, personalized information filtering that highlights relevant content while reducing noise, and AI agents that navigate complex digital ecosystems on behalf of users.</p>
